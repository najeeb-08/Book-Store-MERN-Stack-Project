Book Listings: Users can view all available books in the store.
Search Functionality: Search for books by title, author, or genre.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can add, update, and delete books.
Responsive UI: The frontend is built with React and is fully responsive.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, React Router, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Styling: CSS, Bootstrap
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm must be installed on your system. You can download them from here.
MongoDB should be set up locally or use a MongoDB cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/najeeb-08/Book-Store-MERN-Stack-Project.git
Install backend dependencies: Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT secret>
PORT=5000
Install frontend dependencies: Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Start the application:

Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the frontend server: Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and run:
